# Assignment A2: KVM Virtualisation

### Step 1: Check for Virtualisation

1. Run the following command to check for virtualisation:
   ```bash
   sudo dmesg | grep kvm
   ```
2. Enter your password if prompted.

3. If there is no output, it indicates virtualisation is not enabled.

2. Install the necessary packages 

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system virt-manager
```

3. Add current user to the libvirt group 
```bash
sudo adduser $USER libvirt 
```
4. Enable and start the libvirt service 
```bash
sudo systemctl enable libvirtd.service --now
```

5. Log out of the desktop session and relogin (RESART PC).
